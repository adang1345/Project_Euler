"""Euler's Totient function, phi(n), is used to determine the number of positive numbers less than or equal to n which
are relatively prime to n. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine,
phi(9)=6. The number 1 is considered to be relatively prime to every positive number, so phi(1)=1.

Interestingly, phi(87109)=79180, and it can be seen that 87109 is a permutation of 79180.

Find the value of n, 1 < n < 107, for which phi(n) is a permutation of n and the ratio n/Ï†(n) produces a minimum."""
