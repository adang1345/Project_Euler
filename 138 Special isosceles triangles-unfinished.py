For the case where the h = b+1, we must solve the Diophantine equation 5b^2 - 4L^2 + 8b + 4 = 0. From brute force, its
minimal solution is b = 272, h = 305.
From https://www.alpertron.com.ar/QUAD.HTM, the next solutions are given by
b[n+1] = -9*b[n] - 8*L[n] - 8

For the case where h = b-1, we must solve the Diophantine equation
